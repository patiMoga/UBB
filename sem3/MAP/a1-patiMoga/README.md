# Problem Statements
Write a Java program that solves the requirement below. **NB!** Arguments can be both strings and numbers.

1. Print the prime numbers among the progam's command-line arguments. In case the program is started without command line arguments, prompt the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line. 

2. Print the maximum number value among the progam's command-line arguments. In case the program is started without command line arguments, prompt the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line. 
   
4. Print the minimum value from all the integers among the progam's command-line arguments. In case the program is started without command line arguments, prompt the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line.
   
5. Print the greatest common divisor of all the natural numbers among the program's command-line arguments. In case the program is started without command line arguments, prompt the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line.
   
6. Print the smallest common multiple of all the natural numbers among the program's command-line arguments. In case the program is started without command line arguments, prompt the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line.

# Example (for problem 1)
For command line arguments `1 4 abcd 3 10 99 11 Java Advanced Programming Methods 45 13` the program will display `3 11 13`.
If the command line is empty, the program starts and asks the user to enter the arguments at the program's command line, after which the program calculates and displays the result.
